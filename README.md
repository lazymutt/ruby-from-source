Build Ruby from source, pretty easily.

I prefer Python, but I've always been interested in Ruby. Since macOS doesn't ship a current Ruby (or Python) build, you need to compile it from source or use Homebrew. I've never been a fan of Homebrew. 

Run the script, and it will build and install Ruby and its requirements in ~/local.

1. chmod u+x build_ruby.sh
2. ./build_ruby.sh


It's not difficult to modify if you prefer a different version.

Works on Intel and Apple silicon.
